At the 3rd parliamentary elections in 1956, she contested the Mirigama electorate and was elected, receiving 36,193 votes (75.25% of the total vote) defeating the sitting member, John Amaratunga. In June 1956, she was appointed as Minister of Health in the S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike cabinet, becoming the country's first female cabinet minister. Beginning her duties as the country's Health Minister, Vimala made numerous transformations in what was a male-dominated health system. At the time of her appointment, no female doctors were permitted to be in charge of hospital wards. She changed the system by giving senior doctors the right to oversee wards. Subsequently, Vimala also gave formal recognition to traditional medical practitioners by registering them in the health system. Upon discovering the health system lacked funds, Vimala began a lottery (Arogya) for the explicit purpose of gathering funds. As this enterprise became successful beyond expectation, Arogya was formed into what is now the National Lotteries Board of Ceylon. In June 1958, she was appointed as the Minister for Local Government and Housing. One of her first duties as Minister of Local Government was introducing legislation to allow traditional medical practitioners to grow Marijuana which was essential for their medicinal preparations, saving valuable foreign exchange as it was imported from India. She retained the position of Minister of Local Government and Housing in the subsequent Dahanayake cabinet in 1959. To this day, she remains the only woman to have held this powerful ministry.""","b""Following the death of her older sister, Vimala married her sister's widower Don Charles Wijewardene (1892-1956) at the age of eighteen, who was the fifth son of Don Philip Tudugala Wijewardene; a timber merchant of Sedavatta and Helena Dep (nee Weerasinghe), and was the younger brother of newspaper magnate Don Richard.

Though there had been Tamil populations in the country for centuries, the majority of the estate Tamils had been brought to Ceylon from India by the British authorities as plantation workers. Many Ceylonese viewed them as temporary immigrants, even though they had lived for generations in Ceylon. With Ceylon\'s independence, the Citizenship Act of 1948 excluded these Indian Tamils from citizenship, making them stateless.

He was the son of Andrew Simon Goonewardene, a reputed doctor who served as President of the Panadura Maha Jana Sabha and chairman of the Urban Council. The Goonewardene family were major proprietors of coconut property. Goonewardene's mother died when he was a toddler. She was from the well-known Fernando family of 'Whitehall' Katana, one of the wealthiest families in Ceylon, privately owning very significant amounts of land. Leslie inherited all the wealth from his mother and, as his eldest son, a major share from his father. This wealth allowed Leslie to serve as a major party (LSSP) financier in his later life. His grand-aunt Selestina Rodrigo and another relative Jeramias Dias were the chief sponsors of the Panadura Ronkoth Viharaya and the reputed Panadura Vivadaya debate. Their ancestor Thome Rodrigo was a prince who was a signatory to the Malvana Convention in 1597. As traditional chiefs of the area their ancestors had played a role in defeating Arya Chakrawarti's fleet at Panadura.""","b""As a young child, Goonewardene was educated at St. John's College, Panadura and S. Thomas' College, Mount Lavinia; S. Thomas' is considered to be the most prestigious school in Ceylon, with notable alumni including four former prime ministers of Sri Lanka. Goonewardene's father, Andrew Simon Goonewardene, later sent him to a public (in the British sense of the term) boarding school, Rydal School, in north Wales with the aim of making him a Methodist priest. Instead, Goonewardene became influenced by the widespread Marxist teachings of the time, notably conflicting with his own privilege. This was a major factor leading him to pursue a BSc degree in economics from the London School of Economics, where he was shaped by the teachings of his professor, Harold Laski. He was admitted to the bar at Gray's Inn, one of the four Inns of Court in London, in 1933 but never practised law.""","b""Goonewardene returned to Ceylon from Britain in 1933 and helped found the Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP) on 18 December 1935. It was created with the broad aims of independence from British rule and socialism by a group of young people who had gathered together for that purpose. The group at the commencement numbered six, composed principally of students who had, like Goonewardene, returned from abroad, influenced deeply by the ideas of Karl Marx and Lenin. Goonewardene founded the LSSP alongside N.M. Perera and Colvin R. de Silva, as well as Philip Gunawardena and Robert Gunawardena. Goonewardene was the LSSP's first General-Secretary and served in that role from 1935 to 1977. The party, with the aid of the South Colombo Youth League, initiated various strikes with the aim to disrupt. One such took place at the Wellawatte Spinning and Weaving Mills. Goonewardene also published a Sinhala-language journal, Kamkaruwa (The Worker), allowing the party to become involved in the 1933 Suriya-Mal Movement, whose aim was to generate financial support for indigenous (Ceylonese) veterans through the sale of native Suriya flowers. The Suriya-Mal Movement gained international coverage, propelled by the fact that Poppy Day-raised funds went solely to British ex-servicemen, despite the funds being raised abroad. The Suriya-Mal Movement also helped contribute to the poor and needy during the 19341935 Ceylonese malaria epidemic, which took a toll on poorer communities.""",b''
